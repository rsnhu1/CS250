How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
By presenting and asking for feedback from the team is a great way to interpret user needs.  Since developers and testers will have experience from past projects, they can assist by giving input and providing their interpretations.  Asking the users, clients for feedback will also be beneficial to make sure that I am on the right path and I understand their vision.  User stories help with this because it breaks downs the users needs into managable tasks. By breaking down the project into part I can get a clearer vision of what needs to be dont, how much work and time  will go into each tasks and what is possible or not.  It also helps organize ideas so both me and the team can see a more detailed vision of what the user is asking for.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would approach developing programs using the agile principes of breaking down the project in phases, collaborating with all parts of the team, and continually keeping in contact with the clients to ensure I on track with their vision and am able to make any changes along the way if they are not happy with the current progress or would like to change directions.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member involves being open minded and non judgemental while providing useful feedback.  A good team member should also hold themselves accountable and their teammates.  They must be open to changes and willing to work collaboratively, as well as use active listening skills when listening to the team.
